To start the Bayesian network generator in Lisp:

- Open your Lisp.

- Load the file 'load.cl'.

  This will compile and load the 'statistics' library and then
  the main file 'cpt.cl'.

- Run either generate-undirected-model or generate-bayesian-model
  (see their documentation strings).

  Note that these functions are both quite slow at the moment
  (they will probably take a few hours, depending on the exact
  parameters).
